# LLM-PerfBugPrediction

A research project exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict performance bugs in source code by classifying code snippets as performance buggy or not. This repository contains code and resources related to the study, contributing to the understanding of LLM applications in software performance analysis.

## Objectives

- Explore LLM capabilities in understanding and analyzing source code for performance issues.
- Develop models that classify code snippets as performance buggy or not.
- Contribute to research on applying automated techniques to software performance analysis.

## Repository Contents

1. `data`: Datasets used for training and evaluation.
1. `models`: Implementation scripts for our study
1. `results`: Outputs and evaluation results from experiments.
1. `README.md`: Documentation and deatils of the project.
